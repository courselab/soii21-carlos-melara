 Overview
 ------------------------------

 This directory contains some source code examples meant to illustrate
 some features of the 'make' build automation tool.  The script is based
 on GNU make and makes use of some non-posix extensions.

 Bear in mind that this example is in no way nearly as capable as Atutootls,
 which one is strongly encourage to use for more flexible, portable and
 feature rich build automation. You may learn more about Autootls by
 checking http://gitlab.com/monaco/syseg

 This is a Makefile template for simple C projects aimed to build multiple
 binaries and (static and shared) libraries. It is easily configurable and
 may be further customized for particular needs.

 Please, refer to Makefile itself for further details.
