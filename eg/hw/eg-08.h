/* A function-like macro which prints pointed by str using BIOS' 
   int 0x10 service. 

   Note that we can't pass a quoted literal string like "Foo"
   as argument of this macro, since the argument will be 
   replaced as is within the asm code. Argument str should be
   a label, i.e., a pointer to a statically allocated string.

   This macro clobbers registers eax, ebx and ecx.

   Note the combination \n\t to split lines in a multi-line assembly
