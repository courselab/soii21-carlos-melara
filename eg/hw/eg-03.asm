	;; Notes
	;;
	;; This should produce the same result than mbr-03.asm.
	;; This time, we use a loop to write 'Hello' string, which is naturally
	;; more efficient than manually writing character by character.
	;;
	;; Notice, however that differently from the case of jmp instruction,
	;; which deals with a relative offset, we use msg as a label to an
	;; arbitrary position. This time, there is no way to rewrite msg
	;; using $ --- the assembler has no way to gues the address of the
	;; string. We therefore need to take into account the fact that
	;; BIOS will load the program at the specific address 0x7c00.
	;; 
	;; We don't have any operating system taking care of translating
	;; relative memory address into physical RAM address.
	;;
	;; Welcome to real world.
