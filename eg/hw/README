 Take a look at the following examples.

 * eg-01.hex 	    A minimal bootable program written directly in machine code.
 
		    The source code is an ASCII file containing the opcodes of
		    the program in hexadecimal representation. Conversion into
		    binary form may be accomplished with the aid of auxiliary
		    program bin2ex [1]. This program contains only the boot
		    signature and performs no other behavior.


 * eg-02.hex	    Bare-metal hardcore Hello World in machine code.
 
   		    This is a tough old-school version of the classical
		    Hello World program. It writes the string directly to the
		    BIOS video memory, character by character, one at a time.
		    A Hello World as you have never made before, for the
		    braves. Use bin2ex auxiliary program to build it.

 * eg-04.asm	    The same Hello World now in Intel assembly.

   		    This program implments literally the same algorithm as
		    eg-02.hex, but written in Intel assembly. Use nasm
		    assembler to build the binary.
