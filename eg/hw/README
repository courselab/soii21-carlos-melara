 Take a look at the following examples.

 * eg-01.hex 	    A minimal bootable program written directly in machine code.
		    The source code is an ASCII file containing the opcodes of
		    the program in hexadecimal representation. Conversion into
		    binary form may be accomplished with the aid of auxiliary
		    program bin2ex [1]. This program contains only the boot
		    signature and performs no other behavior.


 * eg-02.hex	    Bare-metal hardcore Hello World in machine code.
   		    This is a tough old-school version of the classical
		    Hello World program. It is a modified version of eg-01.hex
		    which writes directly the string to the video memory.
		    A Hello World as you never made before, for the braves.
		    Use bin2ex auxiliary program to build it.
