 OVERVIEW
 ------------------------------

 In order to experiment with the examples in this section, the following
 pieces of software are required. The version indication lists those with
 which the project was tested. Using a more recent version should be
 ok, but it is not absolutely guaranteed that results may exhibit minor
 variations. Feedback is always appreciated.

 - GCC           9.3.0
 - binutils      2.34

  BUILD DIRECTIONS
 ------------------------------

 Use

   make foo                                  build foo

   make diss IMG=foo                         disassemble name

   make                                      build everything (or make all)

   make clean                                undo make all

 Some examples allow alternative build recipes which can be selected
 by passing the command-line variable ALT=<number> to make. See bellow.


     asm                indicates manually written assembly code in
                        Intel ASM format;

     S                  indicates manually written assembly code
                        in AT&T Gas format;

     s                  indicates assembly code in AT&T Gas format
                        generated by the compiler (GCC);

     o                  indicates object code produced by the assembler;

     bin                indicates binary file generated by the
                        compiler /linker;

     ld                 indicates a linker script.

 Take a look at the following examples.



 * eg-01.c          Very simple program to exemplify the build steps

   		    Execute

		      make eg-01.i           to produce the preprocessed source
		      make eg-01.s           to produce the assembly
		      make eg-01.o	     to produce the object code
		      make eg-01	     to produce the binary

		      ls eg-01.s	     to inspect the assembly
		      make diss IMG=eg-01.o  to disassemble the object
		      make diss IMG=eg-01    to disassemble the executable
