  Acknowledgments
  ---------------

  It is both a moral obligation and a personal pleasure to acknowledge and
  express the due gratitude to my colleague and friend Dr. Renê Souza Pinto
  for his wise advisory and tireless support. If it were not for Renê's 
  enviable technical skills and generosity to promptly share his knowledge,
  as well as his resolute willing to dig into obscure hardware and software
  issues I keep on presenting him, I would likely be stuck in some endless
  Stackoverflow wild quest, struggling with arcane code puzzles.

  I'd like to express my gratitude to my students for their feedback,
  suggestions and source code fixes.
